<h1>Car Rental System - Console Application</h1>
<h3>Overview</h3>
The Car Rental System is a console-based application developed in Java that enables customers to rent cars. It integrates with a MySQL database to store customer data, rental records, and payment details. The system is designed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, making it modular, maintainable, and easy to extend.


<h3>Database Integration:</h3>

The system uses a MySQL database for storing the following:

Customers: Holds customer information (name, contact, address).

Cars: Contains details about the cars available for rent (make, model, price per day).

Rentals: Records rental transactions, including customer, car, rental dates, and total cost.

Payments: Tracks payment information, including the payment status and method used.

<h3>Technologies Used:</h3>

Java: The primary programming language for implementing the systemâ€™s functionality.

MySQL: Relational database for managing data related to customers, cars, rentals, and payments.

JDBC (Java Database Connectivity): Used to connect the Java application to the MySQL database and perform CRUD operations.

<h3>User Experience:</h3>

Console Interface: The user interacts with the system through a simple text-based interface, where they can perform tasks like renting a car, viewing available cars, and making payments.

Error Handling: The system includes error handling for invalid inputs, ensuring a smooth and robust user experience.

<h3>Benefits:</h3>

Real-Time Data: By using MySQL, the system can manage real-time data regarding car availability and rental statuses.

Scalability: The system is designed to be easily scalable, allowing for the addition of new features like discounts, promotional codes, or loyalty programs.

Extensibility: Future improvements or changes (like adding a web or mobile interface) can be made with minimal changes to the core system due to its OOP design.
